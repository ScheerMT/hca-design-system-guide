Inspired by other design systems such as Googleâ€™s  <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/" target="_blank">Material Design</a>, Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/" target="_blank">Human Interface Guidelines</a>, and IBM's <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Design System</a>, it establishes a shared theory and mindset not just for designers, but for everyone involved in the creation of HCA digital products. This shared understanding enables seamless collaboration. </p>
