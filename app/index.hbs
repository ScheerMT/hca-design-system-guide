  <p class="hca-typography--body-1">The HCA Design System is created and maintained by the User Experience team at HCA. Inspired by other design systems such as Googleâ€™s  <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/" target="_blank">Material Design</a>, Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/" target="_blank">Human Interface Guidelines</a>, and IBM's <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Design System</a>, it establishes a shared theory and mindset not just for designers, but for everyone involved in the creation of HCA digital products.</p>

  <p class="hca-typography--body-1">This shared understanding enables seamless collaboration. Each component in the design system was given specific intent. With this mindset, we are equipped to instill the best possible experience for people using HCA digital products.</p>

  <p class="hca-typography--body-1">This design system presents a familiar experience, regardless of what HCA digital product an individual encounters. Familiarity creates comfort and trust. In turn, trust helps establish a continuum of care.</p>
